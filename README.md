# pml_course_project
practical machine learning course project

Using the data set available at http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har,
the scope of the project is to use data produce by self-movement measuring devices 
not only to quantify how much exercise people do but also how well.
The dataset is made up of data collected from accelerometers on the belt, dumbell,
forearm and arm of the participants who were asked to perform exercises in 5 different
ways (correctly and incorrectly).

The repository consists of 2 csv files containing the traininig and the test set,
one png file showing the correlation matrix between variables in the test test (
useful for dimensionality reduction), one R file with the original script and on
Rmd file with the original script in Rmarkdown format, the generated html file and, finally,
the folder containing the files corresponding to the prediction on the test set (as per assignment
instructions one file is generated per each element of the test set).
The script generating the figure was too heavy to keep on the repository so the creation
of the figure has been removed from the final Rmd file.
